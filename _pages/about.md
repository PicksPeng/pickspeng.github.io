Welcome to Yuxiang Peng's homepage.

## **Bio**

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the Purdue University. My research focuses on theoretical and practical explorations of high-assurance software toolchains for quantum computing, including programming languages, compilers, systems, and architectures. My research goal is to help common users harness the power of modern quantum computers in various domain problems. Very recently, I am interested in building optimization solvers with emerging technologies. 

I am actively looking for self-motivated students interested in my research directions. 

I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), University of Maryland, College Park in Spring 2024. I was also affiliated with the [Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science](https://quics.umd.edu/). I was advised by Prof. [Xiaodi Wu](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~xwu/). 
In 2019, I received a Bachelor of Engineering from the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Science](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, and a Bachelor of Science (double major) from the [Department of Mathematical Science](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. In 2022, I received a Master of Science from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), University of Maryland, College Park.
